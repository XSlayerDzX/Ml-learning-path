# Pandas Basics â€” My Learning Notes

This notebook is part of my Machine Learning journey. Iâ€™m currently studying Python libraries essential for data science, and after NumPy, Iâ€™m diving into Pandas â€” a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered:
- Series and DataFrames
- Reading data from CSV and other formats
- Indexing, selecting, and filtering data
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Aggregations and groupby operations
- Merging and joining datasets

ðŸ“Œ Why This Exists:
Iâ€™m learning by documenting what I study, so I retain better and can share it publicly. This is also part of my 3-month ML learning plan to build strong foundations in data science.
